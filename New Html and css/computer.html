            <p class="sectiontag small-text">Education in the Indian subcontinent began with teaching of traditional elements such as Indian religions, Indian mathematics, Indian logic at early Hindu and Buddhist centres of learning such as ancient Takshashila (in modern-day Pakistan)
                and Nalanda (in India). Islamic education became ingrained with the establishment of Islamic empires in the Indian subcontinent in the Middle Ages while the coming of the Europeans later brought western education to colonial India. Several
                Western-style universities were established during the period of British rule in the 19th century. A series of measures continuing throughout the early half of the 20th century ultimately laid the foundation of the educational system of
                the Republic of India, Pakistan and much of the Indian subcontinent.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag small-text">The institutions arranged for multiple residences for educators as well as state sponsored education and arrangements for students and scholars.[11] Similar arrangements were made by the Chola dynasty in 1024 CE, which provided state support
                to selected students in educational establishments. Temple schools from 12–13th centuries included the school at the Nataraja temple situated at Chidambaram which employed 20 librarians, out of whom 8 were copiers of manuscripts and 2
                were employed for verification of the copied manuscripts.[13] The remaining staff conducted other duties, including preservation and maintained of reference material. Another establishment during this period is the Uddandapura institute
                established during the 8th century under the patronage of the Pala dynasty.[14] The institution developed ties with Tibet and became a centre of Tantric Buddhism. During the 10–11th centuries the number of monks reached a thousand, equaling
                the strength of monks at the sacred Mahabodhi complex. By the time of the arrival of the Islamic scholar Al Biruni India already had an established system of science and technology in place. Also by the 12th century, invasions from India's
                northern borders disrupted traditional education systems as foreign armies raided educational institutes, among other establishments.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag small-text">Primary education Ibn Sina wrote that children should be sent to a maktab school from the age of 6 and be taught primary education until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote that they should be taught the Qur'an, Islamic metaphysics,
                language, literature, Islamic ethics, and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).Secondary education Ibn Sina refers to the secondary education stage of maktab schooling as the period of specialization, when
                pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be given a choice to choose and specialize in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading,
                manual skills, literature, preaching, medicine, geometry, trade and commerce, craftsmanship, or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that
                there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account. Literacy In medieval times, the Caliphate experienced a growth in literacy,
                having the highest literacy rate of the Middle Ages, comparable to classical Athens' literacy in antiquity. The emergence of the Maktab and Madrasa institutions played a fundamental role in the relatively high literacy rates of the medieval
                Islamic world.</p>
